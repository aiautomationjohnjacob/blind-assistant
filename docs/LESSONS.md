# Lessons Learned (Autonomous Loop Journal)

> This file accumulates what the AI agents learn each cycle.
> It grows over time and informs future cycle behavior.
> The orchestrator reads this at the start of every cycle to avoid repeating mistakes.

## How to Read This

Each entry is dated and tagged with:
- **PROCESS**: Lessons about how to run the loop better
- **PRODUCT**: Lessons about what blind users actually need
- **TECHNICAL**: Coding or architecture lessons
- **AGENT**: Notes on which agents worked well or got confused

## Cycle 1 — 2026-03-17

**Accomplished**:
- All 7 Phase 1 deliverables completed in one cycle: GAP_ANALYSIS, INTEGRATION_MAP,
  SECURITY_MODEL, ETHICS_REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE, USER_STORIES, FEATURE_PRIORITY
- Full Python project scaffold created (29 source files, correct module structure)
- requirements.txt with pinned deps, config.yaml, README.md, .gitignore, tools/registry.yaml
- Voice-guided installer skeleton (installer/install.py) — substantive but untested
- 21 user stories across 5 blind user personas

**Attempted but failed**: None — all deliverables completed.

**Confusion/loops**:
- PROCESS: The auto-commit system committed many files before manual git add/commit ran.
  git status showed "clean" when files had already been committed. Not a problem but
  confusing mid-session.
  FIX: Use `git log --oneline -5` to confirm what's been committed rather than just
  relying on `git status` being non-empty.

**New gaps detected**:
- `src/blind_assistant/interfaces/voice_local.py` stub was not created — needed for Phase 2
- `src/blind_assistant/second_brain/query.py` not created — needed for Phase 2 Task 3
- Tool implementation files (doordash.py, instacart.py, home_assistant.py) are empty stubs
- No tests exist yet — testing.md requires tests for every component

**Recommendation for next cycle**:
1. AGENT: Start Phase 2 Task 1 — complete Telegram bot + Whisper STT + TTS pipeline end-to-end.
   This creates the first real "the product exists" milestone: user sends voice message,
   gets spoken response back.
2. PROCESS: Create the 2-3 missing stub files (voice_local.py, query.py, tool stubs)
   at the start of next cycle before tackling the main implementation task.
3. PRODUCT: The Phase 2 gate is clear from FEATURE_PRIORITY.md: Dorothy (elder persona)
   and Alex (newly blind) are the test that matters. Build for them first.
